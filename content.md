## History
- **pre-20th century:** low prices spur populist protest movements: the Grange, Farm Alliance or National Farmers Union
- **FDR + the New Deal:** Agriculture Marketing Act of 1929, Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933

Note: "The Agriculture Marketing Act, which established the Federal Farm Board in 1929. AAA reduced agricultural production by paying farmers subsidies not to plant on part of their land and to kill off excess livestock. Its purpose was to reduce crop surplus and therefore effectively raise the value of crops."
