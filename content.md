# 1. Farms and farmers
Note: where are they?


## The "average" farm and farmer
- **receives subsidies:** unequal distribution of $20 billion
- **getting larger:** mean 450 acres, but median at 900 acres
- **making less:** declining ratio to prices, but 2016 average net cash farm income (NCFI) = $102,200
- **getting older:** US Labor Department says 58 years old

## History
- **pre-20th century:** low prices spur populist protest movements: the Grange, Farm Alliance or National Farmers Union
- **FDR + the New Deal:** Agriculture Marketing Act of 1929, Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933
- **post-WWII:** USDA focus on industrialization via Ezra Benson
- **"get big or get out":** Earl Butz, and a shift to a globalized food economy
- **oil crisis and the modern era:** increasing production, declining prices

Note: "The Agriculture Marketing Act, which established the Federal Farm Board in 1929. AAA reduced agricultural production by paying farmers subsidies not to plant on part of their land and to kill off excess livestock. Its purpose was to reduce crop surplus and therefore effectively raise the value of crops."
